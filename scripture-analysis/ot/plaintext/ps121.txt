I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
My help  from the , which made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The   thy keeper: the   thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
The  shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
The  shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
