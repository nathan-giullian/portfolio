How long wilt thou forget me, O ? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul,  sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider  hear me, O  my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the  death;
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;  those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
I will sing unto the , because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
