Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
As  the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,  the nations may tremble at thy presence!
When thou didst terrible things  we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
For since the beginning of the world  have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,  he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,  remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
But we are all as an unclean  and all our righteousnesses  as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
And  none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
But now, O , thou  our father; we  the clay, and thou our potter; and we all  the work of thy hand.
Be not wroth very sore, O , neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we  all thy people.
Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these  O ? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
