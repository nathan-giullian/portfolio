Blessed  every one that feareth the ; that walketh in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy  thou  and  well with thee.
Thy wife  as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the .
The  shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Yea, thou shalt see thy childrenâs children,  peace upon Israel.
