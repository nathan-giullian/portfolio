Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock  is higher than I.
For thou hast been a shelter for me,  a strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. .
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given  the heritage of those that fear thy name.
Thou wilt prolong the kingâs life:  his years as many generations.
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,  may preserve him.
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
