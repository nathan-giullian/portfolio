Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. .
Behold, God  mine helper: the Lord  with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O ; for  good.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen  upon mine enemies.
