Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me  in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long  my glory into shame?  will ye love vanity,  seek after leasing? .
But know that the  hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the  will hear when I call unto him.

Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. .
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the .
 many that say, Who will shew us  good? , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time  their corn and their wine increased.
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, , only makest me dwell in safety.
