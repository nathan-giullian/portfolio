He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make  loins strong, fortify  power mightily.
For the  hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men  in scarlet: the chariots  with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

Where  the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion,  the old lion, walked,  the lionâs whelp, and none made  afraid?
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
Behold, I  against thee, saith the  of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
