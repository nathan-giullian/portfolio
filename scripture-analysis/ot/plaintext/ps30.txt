I will extol thee, O ; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
O  my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
O , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing unto the , O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
For his anger  a moment; in his favour  life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy  in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face,  I was troubled.
I cried to thee, O ; and unto the  I made supplication.
What profit  in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O , and have mercy upon me: , be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
To the end that  glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O  my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
