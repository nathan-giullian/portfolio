Praise ye the . Praise ye the name of the ; praise  O ye servants of the .
Ye that stand in the house of the , in the courts of the house of our God,
Praise the ; for the   good: sing praises unto his name; for  pleasant.
For the  hath chosen Jacob unto himself,  Israel for his peculiar treasure.

For I know that the   great, and  our Lord  above all gods.
Whatsoever the  pleased,  did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
 sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
And gave their land  an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O ,  for ever;  thy memorial, O , throughout all generations.
For the  will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the heathen  silver and gold, the work of menâs hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there  breath in their mouths.
They that make them are like unto them:  every one that trusteth in them.
Bless the , O house of Israel: bless the , O house of Aaron:
Bless the , O house of Levi: ye that fear the , bless the .
Blessed be the  out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the .
