The hills melted like wax at the presence of the , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all  gods.
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O .
For thou, ,  high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.
Ye that love the , hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
