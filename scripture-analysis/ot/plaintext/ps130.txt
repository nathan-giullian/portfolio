Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O .
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If thou, , shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
But  forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
I wait for the , my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
My soul  for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning:  they that watch for the morning.
Let Israel hope in the : for with the   mercy, and with him  plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
