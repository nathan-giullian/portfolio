Praise ye the . Praise the , O my soul.
While I live will I praise the : I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes,  in the son of man, in whom  no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy  that  the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope  in the  his God:
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein  which keepeth truth for ever:
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The  looseth the prisoners:
The  openeth  the blind: the  raiseth them that are bowed down: the  loveth the righteous:
The  preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
The  shall reign for ever,  thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the .
