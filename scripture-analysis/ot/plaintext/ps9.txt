I will praise  O , with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
But the  shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
The  also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, , hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Sing praises to the , which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Have mercy upon me, O ; consider my trouble  of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit  they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
The  is known  the judgment  he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. .

The wicked shall be turned into hell,  all the nations that forget God.
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall  perish for ever.
Arise, O ; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Put them in fear, O :  the nations may know themselves  men. .
