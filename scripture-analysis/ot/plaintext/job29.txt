Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Oh that I were as  months past, as  the days  God preserved me;
When his candle shined upon my head,  by his light I walked  darkness;
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God  upon my tabernacle;
When the Almighty  yet with me,  my children  about me;
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
When I went out to the gate through the city,  I prepared my seat in the street!
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,  stood up.
The princes refrained talking, and laid  hand on their mouth.
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
When the ear heard  then it blessed me; and when the eye saw  it gave witness to me:
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and  none to help him.
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widowâs heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment  as a robe and a diadem.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet  I to the lame.
I  a father to the poor: and the cause  I knew not I searched out.
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply  days as the sand.
My root  spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
My glory  fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Unto me  gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide  for the latter rain.
 I laughed on them, they believed  not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one  comforteth the mourners.
