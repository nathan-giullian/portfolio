O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp: I  will awake early.
I will praise thee, O , among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy  great above the heavens: and thy truth  unto the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
That thy beloved may be delivered: save  thy right hand, and answer me.
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead  mine; Manasseh  mine; Ephraim also  the strength of mine head; Judah  my lawgiver;
Moab  my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
 not  O God,  hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Give us help from trouble: for vain  the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he  shall tread down our enemies.
