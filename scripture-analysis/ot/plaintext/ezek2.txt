And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me,  unto this very day.
For  impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord .
And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they  a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns  with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they  a rebellious house.
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they  most rebellious.
But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.
And when I looked, behold, an hand  sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book  therein;
And he spread it before me; and it  written within and without: and  written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
