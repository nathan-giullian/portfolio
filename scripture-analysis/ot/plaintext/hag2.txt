Thus saith the  of hosts; Ask now the priests  the law, saying,
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
Then said Haggai, If  unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.

In that day, saith the  of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the , and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the  of hosts.
