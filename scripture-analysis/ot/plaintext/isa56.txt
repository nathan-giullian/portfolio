Thus saith the , Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation  near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
Blessed  the man  doeth this, and the son of man  layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the , speak, saying, The  hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I  a dry tree.
For thus saith the  unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose  that please me, and take hold of my covenant;
Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the , to serve him, and to love the name of the , to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices  accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
The Lord  which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather  to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.
All ye beasts of the field, come to devour,  all ye beasts in the forest.
His watchmen  blind: they are all ignorant, they  all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
Yea,  greedy dogs  can never have enough, and they  shepherds  cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.
Come ye,  I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day,  much more abundant.
