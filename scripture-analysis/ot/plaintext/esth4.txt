When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
And came even before the kingâs gate: for none  enter into the kingâs gate clothed with sackcloth.
And in every province, whithersoever the kingâs commandment and his decree came,  great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
So Estherâs maids and her chamberlains came and told  her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received  not.
Then called Esther for Hatach,  of the kingâs chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it  and why it 
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which  before the kingâs gate.
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the kingâs treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew  unto Esther, and to declare  unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
All the kingâs servants, and the people of the kingâs provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called,  one law of his to put  to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
And they told to Mordecai Estherâs words.
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kingâs house, more than all the Jews.
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,  shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy fatherâs house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for  a time as this?
Then Esther bade  return Mordecai 
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which  not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
