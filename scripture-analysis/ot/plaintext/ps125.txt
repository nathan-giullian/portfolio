They that trust in the   as mount Zion,  cannot be removed,  abideth for ever.
 the mountains  round about Jerusalem, so the   round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
Do good, O , unto  good, and to  upright in their hearts.
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the  shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity:  peace  upon Israel.
