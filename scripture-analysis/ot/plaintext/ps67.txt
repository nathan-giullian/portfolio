God be merciful unto us, and bless us;  cause his face to shine upon us; .
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. .
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
 shall the earth yield her increase;  God,  our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
