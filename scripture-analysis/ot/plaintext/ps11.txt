In the  put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee  a bird to your mountain?
For, lo, the wicked bend  bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
The   in his holy temple, the âs throne  in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
The  trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest:  the portion of their cup.
For the righteous  loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
