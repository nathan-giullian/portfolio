The  reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the  is clothed with strength,  he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne  established of old: thou  from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O , the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
The  on high  mightier than the noise of many waters,  the mighty waves of the sea.
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O , for ever.
