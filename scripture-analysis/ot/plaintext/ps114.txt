When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Judah was his sanctuary,  Israel his dominion.
The sea saw  and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams,  the little hills like lambs.
What  thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,  thou wast driven back?
Ye mountains,  ye skipped like rams;  ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Which turned the rock  a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
