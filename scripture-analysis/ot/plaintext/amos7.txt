Thus hath the Lord  shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo,  the latter growth after the kingâs mowings.
And it came to pass,  when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord , forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he  small.
The  repented for this: It shall not be, saith the .
Thus hath the Lord  shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord  called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
Then said I, O Lord , cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he  small.
The  repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord .
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall  by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.
And the  said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it  the kingâs chapel, and it  the kingâs court.
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I  no prophet, neither  I a prophetâs son; but I  an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
And the  took me as I followed the flock, and the  said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
Now therefore hear thou the word of the : Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not  against the house of Isaac.
Therefore thus saith the ; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
