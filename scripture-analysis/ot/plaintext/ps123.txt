Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants  unto the hand of their masters,  as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes  upon the  our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O , have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,  with the contempt of the proud.
