Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him  my salvation.
He only  my rock and my salvation;  my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall  a tottering fence.
They only consult to cast  down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. .
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation  from him.
He only  my rock and my salvation:  my defence; I shall not be moved.
In God  my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,  my refuge,  in God.
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God  a refuge for us. .
Surely men of low degree  vanity,  men of high degree  a lie: to be laid in the balance, they  altogether  than vanity.
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart 
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power  unto God.
Also unto thee, O Lord,  mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
