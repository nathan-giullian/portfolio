Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
I  my belovedâs, and my beloved  mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
Thou  beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as  with banners.
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair  as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
Thy teeth  as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and  not one barren among them.
As a piece of a pomegranate  thy temples within thy locks.
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
My dove, my undefiled is  one; she  the  one of her mother, she  the choice  of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her;  the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Who  she  looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,  terrible as  with banners?
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley,  to see whether the vine flourished,  the pomegranates budded.
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me  the chariots of Amminadib.
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
