Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
Whoso  simple, let him turn in hither:  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine  I have mingled.

Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked  himself a blot.
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give  to a wise  and he will be yet wiser: teach a just  and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the   the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy  understanding.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but  thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear 
A foolish woman  clamorous:  simple, and knoweth nothing.
For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
To call passengers who go right on their ways:
Whoso  simple, let him turn in hither: and  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread  in secret is pleasant.
But he knoweth not that the dead  there;  her guests  in the depths of hell.
