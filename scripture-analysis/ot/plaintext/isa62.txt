For Zionâs sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalemâs sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp  burneth.
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the  shall name.
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the  delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
For  a young man marrieth a virgin,  shall thy sons marry thee: and  the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,  shall thy God rejoice over thee.
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem,  shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the , keep not silence,
And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
The  hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn  meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
Behold, the  hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward  with him, and his work before him.
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the : and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
