Many  which say of my soul,  no help for him in God. .
But thou, O ,  a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
I cried unto the  with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. .
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the  sustained me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set  against me round about.
Arise, O ; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies  the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation  unto the : thy blessing  upon thy people. .
