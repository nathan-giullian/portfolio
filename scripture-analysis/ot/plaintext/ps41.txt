Blessed  he that considereth the poor: the  will deliver him in time of trouble.
The  will preserve him, and keep him alive;  he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
The  will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
I said, , be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see  he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself;  he goeth abroad, he telleth 
All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
An evil disease,  cleaveth fast unto him: and  that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up  heel against me.
But thou, O , be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
Blessed  the  God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
