Shew me thy ways, O ; teach me thy paths.
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou  the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

What man  he that feareth the ? him shall he teach in the way  he shall choose.

Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
