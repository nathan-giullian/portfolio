The  said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
The  shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people  willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
The  hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou  a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill  with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
