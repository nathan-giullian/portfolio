, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth before thee  incense;  the lifting up of my hands  the evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O , before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to  evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
Let the righteous smite me;  a kindness: and let him reprove me;  an excellent oil,  shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also  in their calamities.
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the graveâs mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth  upon the earth.
But mine eyes  unto thee, O  the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snares  they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.

Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
