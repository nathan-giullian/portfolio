Behold, thou  fair, my love; behold, thou  fair; thou  dovesâ eyes within thy locks: thy hair  as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
Thy teeth  like a flock  shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none  barren among them.
Thy lips  like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech  comely: thy temples  like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
Thy neck  like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
Thy two breasts  like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
Thou  all fair, my love;  no spot in thee.
Come with me from Lebanon,  spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lionsâ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,  spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
How fair is thy love, my sister,  spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
Thy lips, O  spouse, drop  the honeycomb: honey and milk  under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments  like the smell of Lebanon.
A garden inclosed  my sister,  spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
Thy plants  an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,  the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
