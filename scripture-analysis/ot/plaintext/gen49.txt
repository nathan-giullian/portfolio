And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you  which shall befall you in the last days.
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Reuben, thou  my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy fatherâs bed; then defiledst thou  he went up to my couch.
Simeon and Levi  brethren; instruments of cruelty  their habitations.
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
Cursed  their anger, for  fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Judah, thou  whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand  in the neck of thine enemies; thy fatherâs children shall bow down before thee.
Judah  a lionâs whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him  the gathering of the people 
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his assâs colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
His eyes  red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he  for an haven of ships; and his border  unto Zidon.
Issachar  a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
And he saw that rest  good, and the land that  pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
I have waited for thy salvation, O .
Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
Out of Asher his bread  fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
Naphtali  a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Joseph  a fruitful bough,  a fruitful bough by a well;  branches run over the wall:
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot  and hated him:
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty  of Jacob; (from thence  the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
 by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Benjamin shall ravin  a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
All these  the twelve tribes of Israel: and this  that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that  in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
In the cave that  in the field of Machpelah, which  before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
The purchase of the field and of the cave that  therein  from the children of Heth.
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
