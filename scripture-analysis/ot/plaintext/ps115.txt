Not unto us, O , not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy,  for thy truthâs sake.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where  now their God?
But our God  in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Their idols  silver and gold, the work of menâs hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them;  every one that trusteth in them.
O Israel, trust thou in the : he  their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the : he  their help and their shield.
Ye that fear the , trust in the : he  their help and their shield.
The  hath been mindful of us: he will bless  he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless them that fear the ,  small and great.
The  shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Ye  blessed of the  which made heaven and earth.
The heaven,  the heavens,  the âs: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
The dead praise not the , neither any that go down into silence.
But we will bless the  from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the .
