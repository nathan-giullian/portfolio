And David arose, and went with all the people that  with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the  of hosts that dwelleth  the cherubims.
And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that  in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which  at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

And the anger of the  was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for  error; and there he died by the ark of God.
And David was displeased, because the  had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.
And David was afraid of the  that day, and said, How shall the ark of the  come to me?
So David would not remove the ark of the  unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of the  continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the  blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.
And it was told king David, saying, The  hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that  unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.

Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
And David said unto Michal,  before the , which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the , over Israel: therefore will I play before the .
And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
