I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the .
Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the , unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the .
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

Peace be within thy walls,  prosperity within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companionsâ sakes, I will now say, Peace  within thee.
Because of the house of the  our God I will seek thy good.
