Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
 thou hast said unto the , Thou  my Lord: my goodness  not to thee;
 to the saints that  in the earth, and  the excellent, in whom  all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied  hasten  another  their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
The   the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant  yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless the , who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
I have set the  always before me: because  at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence  fulness of joy; at thy right hand  pleasures for evermore.
