Hear the right, O , attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer,  not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited  in the night; thou hast tried me,  shalt find nothing; I am purposed  my mouth shall not transgress.
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept  the paths of the destroyer.
Hold up my goings in thy paths,  my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me,  my speech.
Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust  from those that rise up 
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
From the wicked that oppress me,  my deadly enemies,  compass me about.
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Like as a lion  is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O , disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked,  thy sword:
From men  thy hand, O , from men of the world,  their portion in  life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid  they are full of children, and leave the rest of their  to their babes.
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
