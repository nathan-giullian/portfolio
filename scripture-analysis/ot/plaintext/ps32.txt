Blessed  transgression  forgiven,  sin  covered.

Blessed  the man unto whom the  imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit  no guile.
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. .
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. .
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
Thou  my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. .
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
Be ye not as the horse,  as the mule,  have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
Many sorrows  to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the , mercy shall compass him about.
Be glad in the , and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all  upright in heart.
