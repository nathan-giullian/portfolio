Give unto the , O ye mighty, give unto the  glory and strength.
Give unto the  the glory due unto his name; worship the  in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the   upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the   upon many waters.
The voice of the   powerful; the voice of the   full of majesty.
The voice of the  breaketh the cedars; yea, the  breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of the  divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of the  shaketh the wilderness; the  shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the  maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of  glory.
The  sitteth upon the flood; yea, the  sitteth King for ever.
The  will give strength unto his people; the  will bless his people with peace.
