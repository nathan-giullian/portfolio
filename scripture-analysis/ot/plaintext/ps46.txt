God  our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
 the waters thereof roar  be troubled,  the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. .
 a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy  of the tabernacles of the most High.
God  in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her,  right early.
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
The  of hosts  with us; the God of Jacob  our refuge. .
Come, behold the works of the , what desolations he hath made in the earth.
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Be still, and know that I  God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
The  of hosts  with us; the God of Jacob  our refuge. .
