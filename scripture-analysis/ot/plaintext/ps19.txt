The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
 no speech nor language,  their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Which  as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,  rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
His going forth  from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the   perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the   sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the   right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the   pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the   clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the   true  righteous altogether.
More to be desired  than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:  in keeping of them  great reward.
Who can understand  errors? cleanse thou me from secret 
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous  let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O , my strength, and my redeemer.
