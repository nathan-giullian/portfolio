And the word of the  came unto me the second time, saying,
Take the girdle that thou hast got, which  upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

And it came to pass after many days, that the  said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.

For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the ; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.

Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the , Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon Davidâs throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
