Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit  of these abominations;  any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which  before you, and the land is defiled;)
That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that  before you.
For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit  shall be cut off from among their people.
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that  commit not  of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I  the  your God.
