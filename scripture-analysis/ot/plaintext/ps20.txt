The  hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; .
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up  banners: the  fulfil all thy petitions.
Now know I that the  saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Some  in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the  our God.
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, : let the king hear us when we call.
