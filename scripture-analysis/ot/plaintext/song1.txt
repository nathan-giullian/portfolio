The song of songs, which  Solomonâs.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love  better than wine.
Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name  ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
I  black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
Look not upon me, because I  black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my motherâs children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards;  mine own vineyard have I not kept.
Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest  to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherdsâ tents.
I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaohâs chariots.
Thy cheeks are comely with rows  thy neck with chains 
We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
While the king  at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
A bundle of myrrh  my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
My beloved  unto me  a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.
Behold, thou  fair, my love; behold, thou  fair; thou  dovesâ eyes.
Behold, thou  fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed  green.
The beams of our house  cedar,  our rafters of fir.
