If the sun be risen upon him,  blood  for him;  he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges,  whether he have put his hand unto his neighbourâs goods.
For all manner of trespass,  for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment,  for any manner of lost thing, which  challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges;  whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing

If it be torn in pieces,  let him bring it  witness,  he shall not make good that which was torn.

Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
He that sacrificeth unto  god, save unto the  only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
If thou lend money to  my people  poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
If thou at all take thy neighbourâs raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
For that  his covering only, it  his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I  gracious.
Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
Thou shalt not delay  the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen,  with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat  flesh  torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
