Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
Mine enemies would daily swallow  up: for  many that fight against me, O thou most High.
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts  against me for evil.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? in  anger cast down the people, O God.
Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:  not in thy book?
When I cry  then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God  for me.
In God will I praise  word: in the  will I praise  word.
In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Thy vows  upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death:  not  my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
