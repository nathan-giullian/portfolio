On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jewsâ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he  unto her.
And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing  right before the king, and I  pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which  in all the kingâs provinces:
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the kingâs name, and seal  with the kingâs ring: for the writing which is written in the kingâs name, and sealed with the kingâs ring, may no man reverse.
Then were the kingâs scribes called at that time in the third month, that  the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth  thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which  from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerusâ name, and sealed  with the kingâs ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback,  riders on mules, camels,  young dromedaries:
Wherein the king granted the Jews which  in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them,  little ones and women, and  the spoil of them for a prey,
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus,  upon the thirteenth  of the twelfth month, which  the month Adar.
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province  published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
 the posts that rode upon mules  camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the kingâs commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the kingâs commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
