O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. .
That thy beloved may be delivered; save  thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead  mine, and Manasseh  mine; Ephraim also  the strength of mine head; Judah  my lawgiver;
Moab  my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

Who will bring me  the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
 not thou, O God,  hadst cast us off? and  O God,  didst not go out with our armies?
Give us help from trouble: for vain  the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he  shall tread down our enemies.
