My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue  the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon  thigh, O  mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness  righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Thine arrows  sharp in the heart of the kingâs enemies;  the people fall under thee.
Thy throne, O God,  for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom  a right sceptre.
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments  of myrrh, and aloes,  cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
Kingsâ daughters  among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy fatherâs house;
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he  thy Lord; and worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre  with a gift;  the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour.
The kingâs daughter  all glorious within: her clothing  of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the kingâs palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
