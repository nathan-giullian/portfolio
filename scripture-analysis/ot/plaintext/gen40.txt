And it came to pass after these things,  the butler of the king of Egypt and  baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
And Pharaoh was wroth against two  his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph  bound.
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which  bound in the prison.
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they  sad.
And he asked Pharaohâs officers that  with him in the ward of his lordâs house, saying, Wherefore look ye  sadly to day?
And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and  no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them,  not interpretations  to God? tell me  I pray you.
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine  before me;
And in the vine  three branches: and it  as though it budded,  her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
And Pharaohâs cup  in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaohâs cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaohâs hand.
And Joseph said unto him, This  the interpretation of it: The three branches  three days:
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaohâs cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also  in my dream, and, behold,  three white baskets on my head:
And in the uppermost basket  of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
And Joseph answered and said, This  the interpretation thereof: The three baskets  three days:
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
And it came to pass the third day,  Pharaohâs birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaohâs hand:
But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
