The fool hath said in his heart,  no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity:  none that doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were  that did understand, that did seek God.
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy;  none that doeth good, no, not one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people  they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
There were they in great fear,  no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth  thee: thou hast put  to shame, because God hath despised them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel  out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,  Israel shall be glad.
