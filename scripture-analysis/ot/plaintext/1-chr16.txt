And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon 
And he appointed  of the Levites to minister before the ark of the , and to record, and to thank and praise the  God of Israel:
Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
 Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Sing unto the , all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.
Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
For great  the , and greatly to be praised: he also  to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the people  idols: but the  made the heavens.

Give unto the  the glory  unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the  in the beauty of holiness.
Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let  say among the nations, The  reigneth.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that  therein.
Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the , because he cometh to judge the earth.
O give thanks unto the ; for  good; for his mercy  for ever.
And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name,  glory in thy praise.
