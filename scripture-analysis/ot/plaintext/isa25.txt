For thou hast made of a city an heap;  a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.

And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this  our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this  the ; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low,  bring to the ground,  to the dust.
