My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves  for me.
 not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who  he  will strike hands with me?
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt 
He that speaketh flattery to  friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members  as a shadow.
Upright  shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find  wise  among you.
My days are past, my purposes are broken off,  the thoughts of my heart.
They change the night into day: the light  short because of darkness.
If I wait, the grave  mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
I have said to corruption, Thou  my father: to the worm,  my mother, and my sister.

And where  now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when  rest together  in the dust.
