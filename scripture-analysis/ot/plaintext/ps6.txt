O , rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O ; for I  weak: O , heal me; for my bones are vexed.
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O , how long?
Return, O , deliver my soul: oh save me for thy merciesâ sake.
For in death  no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the  hath heard the voice of my weeping.
The  hath heard my supplication; the  will receive my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return  be ashamed suddenly.
