And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all  gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which  upon the top thereof:
And two olive trees by it, one upon the right  of the bowl, and the other upon the left  thereof.
So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What  these, my lord?
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This  the word of the  unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the  of hosts.
Who  thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel  a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone  shoutings,  Grace, grace unto it.
Moreover the word of the  came unto me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the  of hosts hath sent me unto you.
For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel  those seven; they  the eyes of the , which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Then answered I, and said unto him, What  these two olive trees upon the right  of the candlestick and upon the left  thereof?
And I answered again, and said unto him, What  two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden  out of themselves?
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these  And I said, No, my lord.
Then said he, These  the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
