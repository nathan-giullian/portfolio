Except the  build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the  keep the city, the watchman waketh  in vain.
 vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows:  so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children  an heritage of the :  the fruit of the womb  reward.
As arrows  in the hand of a mighty man; so  children of the youth.
Happy  the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
