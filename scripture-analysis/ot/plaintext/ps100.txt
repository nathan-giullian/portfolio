Make a joyful noise unto the , all ye lands.
Serve the  with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

Know ye that the  he  God:  he  hath made us, and not we ourselves;  his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,  into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him,  bless his name.
For the   good; his mercy  everlasting; and his truth  to all generations.
