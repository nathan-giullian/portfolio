Bow down thine ear, O , hear me: for I  poor and needy.
Preserve my soul; for I  holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord,  good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Give ear, O , unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
Among the gods  none like unto thee, O Lord; neither  like unto thy works.
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
For thou  great, and doest wondrous things: thou  God alone.
Teach me thy way, O ; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
For great  thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent  have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
But thou, O Lord,  a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see  and be ashamed: because thou, , hast holpen me, and comforted me.
