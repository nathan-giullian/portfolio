Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God  continually.
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
Thou lovest evil more than good;  lying rather than to speak righteousness. .
Thou lovest all devouring words, O  deceitful tongue.
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of  dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. .
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
Lo,  the man  made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches,  strengthened himself in his wickedness.
But I  like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done  and I will wait on thy name; for  good before thy saints.
