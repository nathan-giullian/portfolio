Behold, how good and how pleasant  for brethren to dwell together in unity!
 like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard,  Aaronâs beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
As the dew of Hermon,  that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the  commanded the blessing,  life for evermore.
