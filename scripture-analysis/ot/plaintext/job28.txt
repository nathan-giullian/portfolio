Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold  they fine 
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass  molten  the stone.
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;  forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
 the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
The stones of it  the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
 a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultureâs eye hath not seen:
The lionâs whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and  hid bringeth he forth to light.
But where shall wisdom be found? and where  the place of understanding?
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.

The depth saith, It  not in me: and the sea saith,  not with me.
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed  the price thereof.
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it  jewels of fine gold.
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom  above rubies.
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where  the place of understanding?
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,  seeth under the whole heaven;
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that  wisdom; and to depart from evil  understanding.
