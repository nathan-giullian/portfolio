Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
 not  thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?

In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,

It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image  before mine eyes,  silence, and I heard a voice, 
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
How much less  them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation  in the dust,  are crushed before the moth?
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding 
Doth not their excellency  in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
