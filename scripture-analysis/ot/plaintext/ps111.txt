Praise ye the . I will praise the  with  whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and  the congregation.
The works of the   great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
His work  honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the   gracious and full of compassion.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands  verity and judgment; all his commandments  sure.
They stand fast for ever and ever,  done in truth and uprightness.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend  his name.
The fear of the   the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do  his praise endureth for ever.
