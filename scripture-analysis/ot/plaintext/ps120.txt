In my distress I cried unto the , and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O , from lying lips,  from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,  I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
I  peace: but when I speak, they  for war.
