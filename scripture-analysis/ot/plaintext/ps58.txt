Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
Their poison  like the poison of a serpent:  like the deaf adder  stoppeth her ear;
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O .
Let them melt away as waters  run continually:  he bendeth  his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
As a snail  melteth, let  pass away:  the untimely birth of a woman,  they may not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in  wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
So that a man shall say, Verily  a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
