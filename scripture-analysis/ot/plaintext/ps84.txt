How amiable  thy tabernacles, O  of hosts!
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,  thine altars, O  of hosts, my King, and my God.
Blessed  they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. .
Blessed  the man whose strength  in thee; in whose heart  the ways 
 passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
They go from strength to strength,  in Zion appeareth before God.
O  God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. .
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
For a day in thy courts  better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For the  God  a sun and shield: the  will give grace and glory: no good  will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
O  of hosts, blessed  the man that trusteth in thee.
