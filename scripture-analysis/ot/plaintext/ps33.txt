Rejoice in the , O ye righteous:  praise is comely for the upright.
Praise the  with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery  an instrument of ten strings.
Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
For the word of the   right; and all his works  in truth.
He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the .
By the word of the  were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the : let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
For he spake, and it was  he commanded, and it stood fast.
The  bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
The counsel of the  standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Blessed  the nation whose God  the ;  the people  he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
The  looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.

He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
An horse  a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver  by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the   upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waiteth for the : he  our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
Let thy mercy, O , be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
