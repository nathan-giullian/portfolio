Thus saith the , Where  the bill of your motherâs divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors  to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
Wherefore, when I came,  no man? when I called,  none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because  no water, and dieth for thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
The Lord  hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to  weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
The Lord  hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.
I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
For the Lord  will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
 near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who  mine adversary? let him come near to me.
Behold, the Lord  will help me; who  he  shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
Who  among you that feareth the , that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh  darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the , and stay upon his God.
Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass  about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks  ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
