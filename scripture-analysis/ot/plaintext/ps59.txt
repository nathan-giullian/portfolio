Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not  my transgression, nor  my sin, O .
They run and prepare themselves without  fault: awake to help me, and behold.
Thou therefore, O  God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. .
They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords  in their lips: for who,  doth hear?
But thou, O , shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
 his strength will I wait upon thee: for God  my defence.
The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see  upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
 the sin of their mouth  the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying  they speak.
Consume  in wrath, consume  that they  not  and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. .
And at evening let them return;  let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God  my defence,  the God of my mercy.
