O sing unto the  a new song: sing unto the , all the earth.
Sing unto the , bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
For the   great, and greatly to be praised: he  to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations  idols: but the  made the heavens.
Honour and majesty  before him: strength and beauty  in his sanctuary.
Give unto the , O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the  glory and strength.
Give unto the  the glory  his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
O worship the  in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Say among the heathen  the  reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
Let the field be joyful, and all that  therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
Before the : for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
