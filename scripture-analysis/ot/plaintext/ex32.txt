And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Mosesâ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they  on mischief.
For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for  this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
