His foundation  in the holy mountains.
The  loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. .
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this  was born there.

The  shall count, when he writeth up the people,  this  was born there. .
As well the singers as the players on instruments  all my springs  in thee.
