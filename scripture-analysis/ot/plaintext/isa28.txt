Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
Therefore thus saith the Lord , Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner  a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

Bread  is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break  the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it  his horsemen.
This also cometh forth from the  of hosts,  is wonderful in counsel,  excellent in working.
