Blessed be the name of the  from this time forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the âs name  to be praised.

The   high above all nations,  his glory above the heavens.
Who  like unto the  our God, who dwelleth on high,
Who humbleth  to behold  in heaven, and in the earth!
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,  lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
That he may set  with princes,  with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house,  a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the .
