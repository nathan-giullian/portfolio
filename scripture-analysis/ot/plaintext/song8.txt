O that thou  as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
I would lead thee,  bring thee into my motherâs house,  would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand  under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake  love, until he please.
Who  this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth  bare thee.
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love  strong as death; jealousy  cruel as the grave: the coals thereof  coals of fire,  a most vehement flame.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she  a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she  a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
I  a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand  of silver.
My vineyard, which  mine,  before me: thou, O Solomon,  a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear 
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
