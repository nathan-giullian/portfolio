The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all  vanity.

What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
 generation passeth away, and  generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea  not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
All things  full of labour; man cannot utter  the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
The thing that hath been, it  which shall be; and that which is done  that which shall be done: and  no new  under the sun.
Is there  thing whereof it may be said, See, this  new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
 no remembrance of former  neither shall there be  remembrance of  that are to come with  that shall come after.
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all  that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all  vanity and vexation of spirit.
 crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all  that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
For in much wisdom  much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
