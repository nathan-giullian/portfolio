Give ear to my words, O , consider my meditation.
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O ; in the morning will I direct  unto thee, and will look up.
For thou  not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the  will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come  thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:  in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
For  no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part  very wickedness; their throat  an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
For thou, , wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as  a shield.
