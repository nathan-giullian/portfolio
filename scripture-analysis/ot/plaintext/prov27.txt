Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
A stone  heavy, and the sand weighty; but a foolâs wrath  heavier than them both.
Wrath  cruel, and anger  outrageous; but who  able to stand before envy?
Open rebuke  better than secret love.
Faithful  the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy  deceitful.
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so  a man that wandereth from his place.
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so  the sweetness of a manâs friend by hearty counsel.
Thine own friend, and thy fatherâs friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brotherâs house in the day of thy calamity:  better  a neighbour  near than a brother far off.
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
A prudent  foreseeth the evil,  hideth himself;  the simple pass on,  are punished.
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand,  bewrayeth 
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
As in water face  to face, so the heart of man to man.
Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
 the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so  a man to his praise.
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,  will not his foolishness depart from him.
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,  look well to thy herds.
For riches  not for ever: and doth the crown  to every generation?

The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
The lambs  for thy clothing, and the goats  the price of the field.
And  goatsâ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and  the maintenance for thy maidens.
