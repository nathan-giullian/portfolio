I am come into my garden, my sister,  spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
I sleep, but my heart waketh:  the voice of my beloved that knocketh,  Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,  my locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
My beloved put in his hand by the hole  and my bowels were moved for him.
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped  myrrh, and my fingers  sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,  was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I  sick of love.
What  thy beloved more than  beloved, O thou fairest among women? what  thy beloved more than  beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
My beloved  white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
His head  the most fine gold, his locks  bushy,  black as a raven.
His eyes  as  of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk,  fitly set.
His cheeks  as a bed of spices,  sweet flowers: his lips  lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
His hands  gold rings set with the beryl: his belly  bright ivory overlaid  sapphires.
His legs  pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance  as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth  most sweet: yea, he  altogether lovely. This  my beloved, and this  my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
