Hear my prayer, O , give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me,  in thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul  after thee, as a thirsty land. .
Hear me speedily, O : my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O , from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do thy will; for thou  my God: thy spirit  good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
Quicken me, O , for thy nameâs sake: for thy righteousnessâ sake bring my soul out of trouble.
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I  thy servant.
