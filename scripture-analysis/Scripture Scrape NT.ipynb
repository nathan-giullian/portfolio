      "He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\n",

      "Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:\n",
      "But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\n",
      "But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.\n",

      "He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\n",
      "But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\n",
      "Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\n",
      "Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:\n",
      "Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\n",
      "Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\n",
      "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:\n",
      "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.\n",
      "Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.\n",
      "He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;\n",
      "The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \n",
      "The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\n",
      "As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.\n",
      "The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;\n",
      "And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n",
      "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n",
      "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n",
      "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n",
      "Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n",
      "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\n",
      "Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\n",
      "So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\n",
      "And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n",
      "Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.\n",

      "And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this  all these things?\n",
      "And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.\n",
      "And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\n",

      "When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.\n",
      "And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.\n",
      "And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and  the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.\n",
      "But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command  to keep the law of Moses.\n",
      "And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.\n",

      "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.\n",
      "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:\n",
      "But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and  fornication, and  things strangled, and  blood.\n",

      "Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n",
      "We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell  the same things by mouth.\n",
      "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;\n",
      "That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.\n",

      "Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:\n",
      "And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,\n",
      "Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.\n",
      "And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.\n",
      "But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.\n",

      "And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming  went into the synagogue of the Jews.\n",
      "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.\n",
      "Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.\n",
      "But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.\n",
      "And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.\n",
      "And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.\n",
      "Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.\n",
      "Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.\n",
      "Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.\n",
      "And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, \n",
