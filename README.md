# Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This collection showcases various projects I've developed to demonstrate my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and technical interests.

## About Me

I'm a business intelligence developer and extremely curious about code and AI. I am interested in data analysis, web scraping, python, and building practical tools. This portfolio represents my journey as I learn new technologies and apply them to interesting problems.

## Projects

### [Scripture Analysis Tool](./scripture-analysis/)
A Python-based project for web scraping and statistical analysis of LDS scriptures. This project demonstrates:
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Text processing and analysis with NLTK
- Data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn

### [Media Space Saver](./media-space-saver/)
*Media takes up a lot of space and for those who save their files locally, it can get expensive. Save space and money by converting photos and videos to HEIC and .h265 types to save space and retain quality. I used this for my NAS and went from 1.78TB to 1.12TB.*

### [Future Project Name](./future-project/)
*Future projects include training a church agent to help with religious research, an iPhone app, and more home-lab projects.*

## Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio demonstrates my experience with:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, *other languages you know*
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis, data visualization, natural language processing
- **Web Technologies**: Web scraping, HTML parsing
- **Tools & Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README with specific instructions for installation and usage. Feel free to explore any project that interests you!

## Future Directions

I'm continuously learning and adding new projects to this portfolio. Current areas of interest include:
- *I really want to use AI in a smart home and even see if I can run a local AI to do basic tasks*
- *I'd love to develop an app on the iOS platform*
- *I'm open to other ideas and will keep updating this*
